How to compile the C++Ocean software:

---First you need a C++ compiler conforming to C++11 norm.

---You need to install the ncl software
   See 
   https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Download/
   and instructions there.

   It is recommended to take the precompiled versions.
   When set up you will have to set up environment variable
   NCARG_ROOT
   You will also need to download the rangs database for coastlines.
   and then set up NCARG_RANGS
     
---EIGEN (Matrix library)
   http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/
   Install it in your path of choice and then set up environment variable
   EIGEN_PATH to this path
   NOTE: There is no need for any compilation since boost is header based.

---NETCDF (version 4)
   Unless you have access via ubuntu or a package management system you
   need to install
   ---First HDF5
      https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html
   ---Then NETCDF-4 C library
      https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp
   ---Then the NETCDF-4 C++ library
      https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp
   After you are done, you need to set up the environment variables
   NETCDF_CXX_ALLINC and NETCDF_CXX_LINK.
   On my system, those variables are set by
   export NETCDF_CXX_ALLINC="-I/home/mathieu/opt/hdf5-1.8.13_ifort14.0.3/include -I/home/mathieu/opt/netcdf-4.3.2_c/include   -I/home/mathieu/opt/netcdf-cxx4-4.2.1/include"
   export NETCDF_CXX_LINK="-L/home/mathieu/opt/hdf5-1.8.13_ifort14.0.3/lib -L/home/mathieu/opt/netcdf-4.3.2_c/lib -L/home/mathieu/opt/netcdf-cxx4-4.2.1/lib -lnetcdf -lnetcdf_c++4 -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/home/mathieu/opt/netcdf-cxx4-4.2.1/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/mathieu/opt/netcdf-4.3.2_c/lib"

---GRIB (version 1.13.1 or above)
   The code is available at
   https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/GRIB/Home
   After you are done with compilation, you need to set up environment variables
   GRIB_INCDIR and GRIB_C_LINK
   On my system this gives
   export GRIB_PATH=/home/mathieu/opt/grib_api-1.13.1_ifort14.0.3_netcdf3.6.3
   export GRIB_FORTRAN_LINK="-L$GRIB_PATH/lib -Wl,-rpath,$GRIB_PATH/lib -lgrib_api_f90 -lgrib_api -lgrib_api_f77"
   export GRIB_C_LINK="-L$GRIB_PATH/lib -lgrib_api -Wl,-rpath,$GRIB_PATH/lib"
   export GRIB_INCDIR="-I$GRIB_PATH/include"
